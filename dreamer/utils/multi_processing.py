"""
Multiprocessing utilities for the Ramanujan Agent pipeline.

This module provides two layers:

1. **Generic parallelism abstraction** (``worker_pool``): a context manager
   that hides all subprocess + queue machinery behind a single ``push(item)``
   callable.  Callers supply a per-item ``worker_fn`` (transform) and a
   per-item ``writer_fn`` (sink).  Setting ``worker_fn=None`` collapses to
   a direct-write loop on the main thread — no subprocesses spawned —
   without changing the producer code.

2. **Stage-specific item functions**: ready-to-use per-item functions
   plugged into ``worker_pool`` by the Search stage:
     - ``compute_tier2_for_item`` — runs ``TIER2_ATTRIBUTES`` for one item.
     - ``write_jsonl_line``     — appends one DTO/patch as a JSON line.

3. **Cross-run dedup helpers**: ``load_seen_trajectories`` and
   ``load_seen_trajectory_ids`` read existing JSONL files so the analyzer
   and search stage can skip already-computed work at the trajectory level.
   ``load_seen_shards`` is a generic helper kept for ad-hoc tools.

    The user always supplies a per-item ``worker_fn`` (transform) and a
    per-item ``writer_fn`` (sink).  Items pushed by the producer flow
    ``push → worker_fn → writer_fn`` in **both** modes — the only thing
    that changes is *where* the transform runs:

    * **Direct mode** (``parallel=False``): ``worker_fn`` runs on the
      producer thread, then ``writer_fn`` writes to the open file.  No
      subprocess is created.
    * **MPMC mode** (``parallel=True``): ``num_workers`` subprocess
      workers apply ``worker_fn`` on items pulled from a bounded task
      queue; results flow through a results queue to a single dedicated
      writer subprocess that owns the file.  All sentinels and joins are
      handled on ``__exit__`` (even when the producer raises).

    When ``parallel`` is left as ``None``, it defaults to ``True`` if
    ``worker_fn`` is provided and ``False`` otherwise — this keeps the
    common case ergonomic (call sites that need to skip subprocess
    spin-up just pass ``parallel=False``).

    ``worker_fn=None`` is shorthand for the identity function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_workers:
        Number of worker subprocesses to spawn.  Ignored in direct mode.
    worker_fn:
        Per-item transform: takes ``item``, returns the (possibly modified)
        item to be written.  Must be picklable in MPMC mode (typically a
        module-level function).  ``None`` selects an identity transform.
    writer_fn:
        Per-item sink: takes ``(item, fout)`` and writes one record.  Must
        be picklable in MPMC mode.  ``fout`` is an open append-mode handle.
    output_path:
        Destination file path.  Opened on the writer side (or main thread
        in direct mode).
    config_overrides:
        Returned by ``config.export_configurations()`` in the parent;
        propagated to every subprocess via ``_init_worker``.
    queue_maxsize:
        Bounded task-queue capacity.  Defaults to ``max(32, 4 * num_workers)``,
        large enough that the producer rarely stalls waiting for consumers.
    parallel:
        Explicit subprocess on/off.  Defaults to ``True`` when ``worker_fn``
        is provided, ``False`` otherwise.

    Yields
    ------
    A ``push(item)`` callable.  Producer code calls it once per work item.
