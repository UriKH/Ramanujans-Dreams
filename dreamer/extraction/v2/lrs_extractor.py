"""
Exact shard extractor.

Pipeline per call:

1. Enumerate every non-empty cell of the arrangement (sign vectors) via
   :func:`dreamer.extraction.v2.cells.iter_cells` (memoryless reverse
   search), streamed so classification can interleave.
2. Classify each cell as bounded / unbounded.  Two backends:
   * ``"lp"`` (default) — one in-process recession-cone LP per cell
     (`cells.make_unbounded_checker`), ~0.5 ms, no subprocess.
   * ``"lrs"`` — spawn the lrslib ``lrs`` binary, compute the cell's
     V-representation and look for a ray.  Kept as an authoritative
     cross-check; ~30x slower per cell due to subprocess + full vertex
     enumeration.
3. For each unbounded cell, witness it with an integer point via
   :func:`dreamer.extraction.v2.milp.find_integer_point`.
