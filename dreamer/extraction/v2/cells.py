Sign-pattern (cell) enumeration for a hyperplane arrangement.

Given ``N`` hyperplanes ``A x + c = 0`` in :math:`\mathbb{R}^D`, the
arrangement partitions space into open cells; each cell is uniquely
labelled by a sign vector ``s in {-1, +1}^N``.  Iterating over all
``2^N`` sign vectors is infeasible past ``N ~ 25``, but the number of
*non-empty* cells is bounded by :math:`O(N^D)`.

Enumeration: Avis–Fukuda reverse search
=======================================

We enumerate cells by **memoryless reverse search** (Avis & Fukuda,
"Reverse search for enumeration").  Pick a generic *base* cell (sign
vector ``base``); every other non-empty cell ``c`` is assigned a unique
*parent*

    parent(c) = flip ``c`` at the minimum index ``i`` such that
                ``c[i] != base[i]``  (separating)  and
                ``flip(c, i)`` is itself a non-empty cell.

Because ``parent`` strictly reduces the Hamming distance to ``base``,
iterating it from any cell reaches ``base`` — so the parent pointers
form a spanning tree rooted at the base cell.  We enumerate by walking
that tree *forwards*: a neighbour ``c'`` of ``c`` (one sign flipped) is
a child of ``c`` iff ``parent(c') == c``.

Why reverse search over BFS?  No ``seen`` set is needed (each cell is
reached through its unique parent exactly once), so

* memory is ``O(tree depth)`` instead of ``O(#cells)``, and
* disjoint subtrees can be dispatched to separate processes with zero
  shared state — see ``num_workers``.

Feasibility backend (hot-started stateful solver)
=================================================

The per-cell non-emptiness test dominates runtime.  We build the LP
**once** and navigate by swapping variable *bounds* only:

* Coordinate variables ``x in [-bound, bound]^D``.
* Auxiliary variables ``y_i`` with static constraints
  ``A_i . x + c_i - y_i = 0`` (never modified — the simplex basis is
  reused across checks).
* A sign vector maps to ``y`` bounds: ``s_i = +1`` => ``y_i in [eps, inf)``;
  ``s_i = -1`` => ``y_i in (-inf, -eps]``.  Feasibility of those bounds
  proves the open cell has interior of slack ``>= eps``.

CBC (via ``python-mip``) hot-starts from the previous basis because
only bounds change.  When ``python-mip`` is unavailable we fall back to
the original per-call ``scipy`` LP so the module never hard-fails.
